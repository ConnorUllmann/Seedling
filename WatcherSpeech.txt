You...
You're the reason for all of this.
The Watcher sees all, and he sees you with your... weapons.
The Watcher watched you kill the Shieldspire, the Times...
...the Totem of Lacste, the Tentacled Beast, the Lights, the King of Fire...
...even burning the Owl to death in his own nest.
While you mauled your victims...
Did you ever once think?
How you kill everything, everything in your path.
All for this?
This little seed, a seed that will serve to please a master you've only but met?
The Watcher saw you, and he tried to stop you.
It was the Watcher that dropped the Sky Rock when you killed the Shieldspire.
Little did he know that it would only cause you to destroy until you found a way around it.
It pushed you to do more than the Watcher could imagine.
This is why the Watcher must stop you.
If you want this seed, you will have to kill the Watcher.
Here, before you. In cold blood.
If you turn back to find a seed without bloodshed, only then can you redeem yourself.
