The world is changing.

Is it a good change?  Your character makes it happen.

:Arching Characters:

Oracle
	-Seeks you out, speaks loftily, very idealistic, and has a lot of hope and ideas that you're going to do SOMETHING.
	-Ridiculous and grandiose at times.
	-Nice guy, well-intentioned.
	-Not very worldly, but you think he is at the start.
Hermit
	-Antithesis of the Oracle.
	-Bitter, lonely, hateful little man.
	-Semi-worldy, smart, and very knowledgeable.
	-He starts using you as his only friend/contact with the world.
	-Doesn't know what you're doing (oblivious to your work and intentions).
		-When he finds out, he's a little shocked.
You
	-Unknowing, impressionable.
	-Becomes goal-oriented initially.
	-Timid and confident at times.
Carlor
	-Big talker.
	-Hidden in a corner.
	-Shows you where the treasure lies, but leads you into trouble in the process.
		-When you get out, he thinks he's helped you (even though he got you into trouble and you're a bit angry).
"Princess"

:Sword/Shield Dungeons:

In the beginning, you feel a wild inclination (further enhanced by the Oracle's "destiny" speech at the start.  He's a wild guy, but you don't know that yet).  You see a dungeon at the start, you go through and get the sword. Come out of the dungeon, and the moonrock falls.  No explanation is given--leaves the player guessing (possibly a confused bystander).  Go to the shield dungeon, where you face the Totem, who doesn't talk and is a sort of pawn.  You kill him, taking the first unlock key, and getting the shield.  You exit and go to the woods:

:Woods:

Meet people in the woods:
	-Some are optional and some are not.
	-Optional:
		-Witch: "Mmm... are you a friendly face?" "You look nice enough." "...But I like my privacy." "That is an interesting insignia you carry." "...reminds me of the Totem I built..."
			-Maybe add a side quest.
		-Blandashurmin: "Don't take mah gold!" "...oh, Shrum." "Sorry ol' boy. I get a bit touchy with newcomers. Didn't recognize you there."
		-Bar drunk; "Ya know... I used to be married to that old witch up there." "...grrg..." "...she was the sweetest..." DRUNK CHANGE: "...I used to bring Gertrude *** from the ***" "..." "...drove 'er to pieces, it did, gosh blesh 'er."
		-Bartender: 

Woods dungeon bosses:
	-Generations of time.
	-Tempus, Andaga, and Zeit (german time).
	-Tempus follows you and just swings his hammer at you.
		-"..., ...?" "..." "...!" talks with silence, then you fight.
	-Andaga swings his poles like a clock.
		-"...never..." "ages..." "...seen..." "...odd." "...for...minutes?" "seconds...hours..." "mine!"
		-"never in my time here--the ages--have I seen something so odd.  Have you come for my minutes?  My seconds and hours?  Mine!"
	-Zeit attacks you with swords.
		-"Time is stasis." "You bring much conflict." "Is it my place to resist?" "Seems I must."

	-The "times" never do anything and remain in the woods without interaction with the world.
