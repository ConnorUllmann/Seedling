You...~You're the reason for all of this.~I see all, and I've seen you with your... weapons.~I watched you kill the Shieldspire, the Times...~...the Totem of Lacste, the Tentacled Beast, the Lights, the King of Fire...~...even burning the Owl to death in his own nest.~While you mauled your victims...~Did you ever once think?~How you kill everything, everything in your path.~All for this?~This little seed, a seed that will serve to please a master you've only but met?~I saw you, and I tried to stop you.~It was I that dropped the Sky Rock when you killed the Shieldspire.~Little did I know that it would only cause you to destroy more.~It pushed you to do more than I could have imagined.~This is why I must stop you.~If you want this seed, you will have to kill me.~Here, before you. In cold blood.~If you turn back to find a bloodless seed, only then will you be redeemed.~Now, kill me or find another way.
